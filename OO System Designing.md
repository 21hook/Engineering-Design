### OO Characteristics
* Abstract # construct a corresponding object & operation abstraction 
* Encapsulation # encapsulate the operations & state of the object as an isolated unit
* Inheritance # automatically get the public operations & state of its superclasses, according to the family tree 
* Polymorphism # Use the same code for more than one data type

### OO Principles
* Favor composition over inheritance.

### OO Patterns
* Creator # define a template for creating an object using a class 
* Factory method # define a class for creating an object, but let the subclass decides which class 
to instantiate  
* Template method # provide a common code pattern for a category of types
