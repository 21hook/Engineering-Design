### Engineering Design
An overview of design logic and strategies in System Engineering Fields.

### Software in OS 
* Technology # Up to knowledge
* Application # Down to earth
* Software
    
    Ex: Evaluator| Interpreter 
    
        Technoloy
            the knowledge about the system to be modeled, From the perspective of 
            the object-oriented data model & programming paradigm, to evaluate the system 
            you want to model. => 采取这套理论框架来形式化系统, 
            The object-oriented logic is the system logic.
            
            the organization strategies of the system
                objected-oriented paradigm & data model
                stream-processing paradigm & data model   
            
                          
        Application
                arithmetic evaluator, read-eval-print loop, illegal expressions

### Software Construction 
* Minimizing complexity # easier to understand, read    
* Anticipating change # ready for change, maintain
* Constructing for verification # safe from bug, usability testing
