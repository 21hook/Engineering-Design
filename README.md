### Engineering-Design
An overview of design logic and strategies in System Engineering Fields.

### Design Logic
* Technology # Up to knowledge
* Application # Down to earth
* Software
    
    
    Ex: Evaluator|Intepretor 
    
        Technoloy
            the knowledge about the system to be modeled
            
            the organization strategies of the system
                objected-oriented paradigm & data model
                stream-processing paradigm & data model   
            exception handling
                          
        Application
                arithmetic evaluator, read-eval-print loop, illegal expressions
                
### Object-oriented Data model & Paradigm
    
    Ex:
        Interpreter
        
        
     
    
                 
                
From the perspective of the object-oriented data model & programming paradigm, to evaluate the system you want 
to model. => 采取这套理论框架来形式化系统, The object-oriented logic is the system logic.
