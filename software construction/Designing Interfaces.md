#### Interface Principles
* Unified # Provide an unified & consistenet abstraction. The methods of a class should reflect a unified theme, and behave in a consistent spec/convention as soon as possible
* Sufficient # Meet the needs of the client. The implmentor should think about the needs of a class from the perspective of the client
* Simple # Meeting the requirements of case computaions, reduce the number of arguments of a method, or eliminate the method for the special case
* General # Concentrate on the general auidence of  the class. when you decide to encapsulate the particular tool in a class
* Stable # The public methods or constants of a class should maintain the same structure and effect, although the package including the class evolves
